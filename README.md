# Usage examples
The following notebooks contains usage examples of DPAD for several use-cases:
1. Simulation notebook: [source/DPAD/example/DPAD_tutorial.ipynb](https://github.dev/ShanechiLab/DPAD/blob/main/source/DPAD/example/DPAD_tutorial.ipynb). 
2. **[NEW!]** Notebook with real neural-behavioral data: [source/DPAD/example/DPAD_tutorial2.ipynb](https://github.dev/ShanechiLab/DPAD/blob/main/source/DPAD/example/DPAD_tutorial2.ipynb). 

# Usage examples
The following documents explain the formulation of the key classes that are used to implement DPAD (the code for these key classes is also available in the same directory):

- [source/DPAD/DPADModelDoc.md](./source/DPAD/DPADModelDoc.md): The formulation implemented by the `DPADModel` class, which performs the overall 4-step DPAD modeling.

-  [source/DPAD/RNNModelDoc.md](./source/DPAD/RNNModelDoc.md): The formulation implemented by the custom `RNNModel` class, which implements the RNNs that are trained in steps 1 and 3 of DPAD. 

-  [source/DPAD/RegressionModelDoc.md](./source/DPAD/RegressionModelDoc.md): The formulation implemented by the `RegressionModel` class, which `RNNModel` and `DPADModel` both internally use to build the general multilayer feed-forward neural networks that are used to implement each model parameter. 

We are working on various improvements to the DPAD codebase. Stay tuned!
